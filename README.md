Full text of the flashcards I use to memorize syntax

Spaced repitition is a good way to remember things, and programming is more fun when you spend less time in the help docs.

These text files contain the questions and answers I use to practice. Usually they are organized easy to difficult with concepts building on top of each other. Syntax or concept questions usually are phrased for a short response, but questions requiring code can be long and are for getting the language on the tip of your fingers and practicing logic.
